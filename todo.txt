By order of priority

- train and aggregate with PET k(=3) models/pattern
- add classical training and compare with it (for the same number of training examples, i.e 32)
- add priming (REAL few shot learning, works with LARGE SCALE LLMs) and compare with it
- implement iPET and observe improvements (?)
- summarize comparisons with plots, analyze...
- eventually: implement PET with several masks
